title: OpenAI Python Code
summary: How to use the OpenAI Python SDK with WorkflowAI. WorkflowAI exposes a compatible OpenAI API endpoint. The only changes you need to make are updating the `base_url` and `api_key`.
---

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# setup WorkflowAI client
client = OpenAI(
  base_url="https://run.workflowai.com/v1", # [!code highlight]
  api_key="wai-***", # use create_api_key MCP tool // [!code highlight]
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  # TODO:
  # add structured output, metadata, input variables
  # response cost, latency
)
```
