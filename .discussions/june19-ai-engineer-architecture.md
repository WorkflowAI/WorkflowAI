# AI Engineer Agent architecture

- [ ] The agent should have access to the following tools:
- [ ] `search_documentation(query)` to search the documentation of the WorkflowAI platform. Another alternative approach would be to expose the `search_documentation` tool in our MCP server, we can try, but i'm concerned that the MCP client would have to decide between two tools (`ask_ai_engineer` and `search_documentation`).
