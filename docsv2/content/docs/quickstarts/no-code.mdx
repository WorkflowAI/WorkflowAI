  When building your AI feature, it's helpful to consider three key aspects:

- **Goal**: Clearly describe how input data transforms into output data
  - *Example*: Extracting calendar events detected in a list of provided emails
- **Input**: The type of data that the AI will be given to process
  - *Example*: A list of emails
- **Output**: The type of data the feature will produce  
  - *Example*: A list of calendar events

### Create your free account

Visit [workflowai.com](https://workflowai.com) to create your free account. We give you $10 in credits to get started, so you can begin building and testing your AI features right away.

</Step>

<Step>

### Start building your AI feature

Once you're logged in, tap the **"New"** button, then select **"Create new AI feature"** to begin building your first AI-powered functionality.

</Step>

<Step>

### Describe what you want to build

Write a clear description of the feature you want to build and send it to the AI. The more specific you are about your goals, inputs, and expected outputs, the better WorkflowAI can help you create the perfect AI feature.

### Next: Test and improve your agent

Now that your AI feature is created, head over to the [playground](/docs/playground) to test your agent and make improvements. The playground is where you can refine your agent's behavior, test different scenarios, and ensure it works perfectly for your use case. To help make your agent the best it can be, all the features below are automatically enabled:
