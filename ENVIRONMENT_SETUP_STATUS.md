## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Python 3.13 Compatibility Issues

Some Python packages have compilation issues with Python 3.13.3:

#### 1. **httptools (0.6.1)**
- **Issue**: C extension compilation fails with Python 3.13 internal API changes
- **Error**: `_PyLong_AsByteArray` function signature mismatch
- **Impact**: uvicorn dependency chain affected
- **Status**: Blocking full Python environment setup

#### 2. **uvloop (0.20.0 → 0.21.0)**
- **Issue**: Version 0.20.0 incompatible with Python 3.13
- **Solution Found**: Version 0.21.0beta1 supports Python 3.13
- **Status**: Working version available but lock file conflicts

#### 3. **tiktoken & tokenizers**
- **Issue**: PyO3 (Rust-Python bindings) not supporting Python 3.13
- **Workaround**: `PYO3_USE_ABI3_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY=1` flag available
- **Status**: Potential workaround available

## 🚀 Ready for Development

### What Works Now
1. **Frontend Development**: Full Next.js/React environment ready
2. **Python Development**: Core tools (pytest, ruff, pyright) working
3. **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, and type checking available
4. **Package Management**: Both Poetry and Yarn fully functional

### What's Limited
1. **FastAPI Server**: May have issues due to uvicorn dependencies
2. **AI/ML Features**: tiktoken/tokenizers compilation issues
3. **Full Backend**: Some async/web framework dependencies affected

---

## 🔄 Recommended Actions

### Immediate (for current development)
1. **Frontend work**: Fully functional, no blockers
2. **Python core development**: Available with current package set
3. **Testing**: Dev tools available for both Python and JavaScript

### For Full Backend Support
1. **Option A**: Wait for official Python 3.13 support in packages
2. **Option B**: Use environment variables for PyO3 compatibility
3. **Option C**: Set up Python 3.12 environment (requires sudo access)

### Future Monitoring
- Track uvloop 0.21.0 stable release
- Monitor httptools updates for Python 3.13 support
- Watch for PyO3 Python 3.13 compatibility updates

## 🎯 Conclusion

The WorkflowAI development environment is **substantially ready** for development work. The core tooling for both frontend and backend development is installed and functional. The main limitation is with some Python packages that haven't yet been updated for Python 3.13 compatibility, which is a common issue in the early days of a new Python release.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with development work using the current setup, monitoring for package updates as they become available.
