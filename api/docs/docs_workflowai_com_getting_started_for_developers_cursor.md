CursorAI integration is currently only available for Python.

For developers using Python, we've designed a CursorAI integration that allows you to create AI agents in CursorAI, and deploy them to WorkflowAI.

Goals of the integration:

- give CursorAI the flexibilty to create or update a AI agent directly in code,

- but keep the power of WorkflowAI playground to compare models side-by-side,

- use any models available on WorkflowAI,

- and integrated with WorkflowAI observability and evaluation platform.


We've designed this integration to give you the best of both worlds between code and WorkflowAI web-app:

- on one hand, you can use code to define any AI agent directly,

- but on the other hand, you can use the WorkflowAI web-app for features that are more suited for a dedicated UI (like model comparison, observability, evaluations, etc).

CursorAI agents allows you to build workflows easily. Workflows are multiple agents working together to achieve a task.
