title: Cost Metadata
summary: Understand how WorkflowAI simplifies cost tracking by providing estimated costs for each API request. Learn how to access this cost metadata programmatically.

import { Tabs, Tab } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

While most standard LLM APIs return usage metrics (like input and output token counts), they typically don't provide the actual monetary cost of the request. Developers are often left to calculate this themselves, requiring them to maintain and apply up-to-date pricing information for each model.

WorkflowAI simplifies cost tracking by automatically calculating the estimated cost for each LLM request based on the specific model used and WorkflowAI's current pricing data.

### Programmatically

TODO:
- adjust the code for this section, the cost and latency are inside the array choices[]
- add WorkflowAI SDK and REST API examples

<Tabs items={["curl", "OpenAI SDK (Python)", "OpenAI SDK (Ruby)", "Instructor (Python)"]}>

  ```

  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```python
  class Answer(BaseModel):
      sentiment: str
      score: float

  answer, completion = client.chat.completions.create_with_completion(
      model="gpt-4o-mini",
      response_model=Answer,
      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "I love Workflow AI!"}],
      metadata={"agent_id": "sentiment-analysis-agent"}
  )

  cost = completion.model_extra.get('cost_usd')
  latency = completion.model_extra.get("duration_seconds")
  print(f"Latency (s): {latency:.2f}")
  print(f"Cost   ($): ${cost:.6f}")
