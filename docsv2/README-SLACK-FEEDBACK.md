# Slack Feedback Setup

This documentation uses a feedback component that sends user feedback directly to a Slack channel.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Slack Webhook URL**:
   - Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
   - Create a new app or select an existing one
   - Enable "Incoming Webhooks" feature
   - Add a new webhook to your workspace and select a channel
   - Copy the webhook URL

2. **Configure Environment Variable**:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add:
   ```
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
   ```

3. **How it works**:
   - Users can rate each documentation page as "Good" or "Bad"
   - They can optionally add a message with their feedback
   - The feedback is sent to your Slack channel with:
     - Page URL
     - User opinion (Good/Bad)
     - Optional message
     - Timestamp

## Customization

You can customize the Slack message format by editing `app/actions/slack-feedback.ts`.

## Message Format

The feedback appears in Slack as an attachment with:
- Green color for positive feedback (üëç)
- Red color for negative feedback (üëé)
- Page URL, opinion, timestamp, and optional message

## Security

- The Slack webhook URL is kept server-side only
- Feedback is rate-limited by localStorage (one feedback per page per session)
- No personal user data is collected
