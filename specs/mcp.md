# MCP

## Week 1

### Demo

in Cursor, setup a new repo with MCP enabled for WorkflowAI.

then write the following goal:

```
using WorkflowAI:
- write a AI agent that can summarize a text. if there is a URL in the text, extract the text from the URL to be able to write an accurate summary.
- find a model that works well for this task
- and is cheap.
give me 3 options (models) from choose from with pros and cons.
```

notes:
- for the authentication, we can use a API key passed as a configuration of the MCP server on Cursor, to start simple. we know there is **no** UX risk on the install/authentication process.

how well can the agent in Cursor perform this goal??
should we assume the agent run independantly in the background, or the user is coding with the agent? i think we should try the background agent first, since the agent can write code and also run the code or the unit tests if the repo setup is simple (which is the case for this demo).

what tools needs to be exposed in the MCP?
- `chat` to interact with our own AI agent, or maybe `search_documentation` to search the documentation of WorkflowAI?
- my guess is that a `chat` would be more powerful because the agent could ask follow up questions. (basically the chat is a better interface for humans, so I'm assuming chat is a better interface for AI agents too)
- the tool `chat` needs to have a way to require a `chat_id` parameter that would be consistent across the chat (implemented below).

```python
# server.py
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Demo ðŸš€")

# https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools
@mcp.tool
async def chat(chat_id: str, message: str) -> str:
    # docstring is passed as the tool's description by default
    """
    Ask questions about:
    - how to use WorkflowAI, get help with implementation.
    - how to use the tools available in WorkflowAI.
    - how to use the models available in WorkflowAI.
    - send error messages and get help with implementation.

    The chat_id needs to be consistent across a chat. If you want to start a new chat, you need to provide a new chat_id.

    Example:
    message: "I want to build a chatbot that can check the weather in a city. How can I do that?"
    chat_id: "123"

    message: "This error is happening <error message>, can you help me fix it?"
    chat_id: "123"
    """
    return "Hello, world!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```
