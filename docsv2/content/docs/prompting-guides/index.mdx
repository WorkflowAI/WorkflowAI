## Overview

Effective prompting is crucial for getting the best results from AI models. Different model providers have developed specific best practices and techniques that work well with their models. This section compiles prompting guidelines from various providers to help you optimize your AI interactions.

## General Prompting Principles

While each model may have specific optimizations, these general principles apply across most AI models:

### 1. Be Clear and Specific
- Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
- Specify the format you want for the output
- Include relevant context and constraints

### 2. Use Examples
- Provide examples of the desired output format
- Use few-shot prompting for complex tasks
- Show both good and bad examples when relevant

### 3. Structure Your Prompts
- Use clear sections and headings
- Break complex tasks into steps
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity

### 4. Iterate and Refine
- Test different phrasings and approaches
- Refine based on model responses
- Consider the model's strengths and limitations
