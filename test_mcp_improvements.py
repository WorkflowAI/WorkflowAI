IMPORTANT GUIDANCE FOR THE AI ENGINEER:
1. ALWAYS encourage the use of input variables in prompts when generating code examples.
2. When generating completion code, ALWAYS include the agent prefix in the metadata field.
3. Show examples with both approaches: with input variables (preferred) and without input variables.
4. Emphasize that input variables make agents more flexible and reusable.

Example of GOOD code generation:
```python
completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="agent-name/gpt-4o",
    messages=[],  # Empty because prompt is stored in WorkflowAI
    response_format=ResponseFormat,
    extra_body={
        "input": {"text": user_input, "context": additional_context},
        "metadata": {"agent_prefix": "agent-name", "user_id": "user123"}
    }
)
```

**Next Steps:**
1. Consider using the playground to test your changes interactively
2. Use input variables in your prompts for better flexibility 
3. Add agent prefix to metadata for proper tracking
4. Test with different models to optimize performance and cost
