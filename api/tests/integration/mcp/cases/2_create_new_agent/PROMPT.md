I want to add a route that can summarize a provided text using a WorkflowAI agent

- if there is a URL in the text, extract the text from the URL to be able to write an accurate summary.
- find a model that works well for this task and is cheap.

After modifying the code, give me 3 options (models) from choose from with pros and cons.
