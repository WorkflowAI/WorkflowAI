title: Instructor Python Code
summary: How to use the Instructor Python SDK with WorkflowAI. WorkflowAI exposes a compatible OpenAI API endpoint. The only changes you need to make are updating the `base_url`, `api_key`, and use the recommended `mode`.
---

```python
import instructor
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

# setup WorkflowAI client
workflowai_client = OpenAI(
  base_url="https://run.workflowai.com/v1", # [!code highlight]
  api_key="wai-***", # use create_api_key MCP tool // [!code highlight]
)

client = instructor.from_openai(workflowai_client,
  # recommended mode, but other modes are supported
  mode=instructor.Mode.OPENROUTER_STRUCTURED_OUTPUTS, # [!code highlight]
  ... # your existing code
)
```
