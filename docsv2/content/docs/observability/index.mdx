## What is observability?

explain why...
- AI is non-deterministic, so you need a way to debug what's happening.

## Setup

<Steps>
<Step>

### Go through the Quickstart

Because inference requests are going through WorkflowAI, observability is enabled automatically as soon you have completed the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstarts).

</Step>

<Step>

### Observability is enabled automatically

Once you've completed the quickstart and made your first request through WorkflowAI, observability features are automatically activated for your agent. This includes:

- **Request tracking**: Every API call is logged and tracked
- **Performance metrics**: Latency, cost, and token usage are automatically calculated
- **Error monitoring**: Failed requests and their reasons are captured
- **Usage analytics**: Detailed insights into your agent's performance over time

You don't need to install any additional packages or configure logging - it all works out of the box.

</Step>

<Step>

### Identify your agent

To properly organize your observability data, you can identify your agent using two methods:

#### Method 1: Metadata field (Preferred)

The recommended approach is to use the `agent_id` field in the `metadata` parameter:

```python
response = client.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[...],
    metadata={
      "agent_id": "my-agent-id", # [!code highlight]
    }
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Clean separation between model selection and agent identification
- Works with all deployment types and configurations
- Easier to manage and modify agent identification

#### Method 2: Model parameter prefix (Alternative)

When editing metadata isn't possible or practical, you can include the agent ID as a prefix in the model parameter:

```python
response = client.completions.create(
    model="my-agent-id/gpt-4o", # [!code highlight]
    messages=[...],
)
```

**Use cases:**
- When working with frameworks that don't support custom metadata
- When integrating with existing systems where metadata modification is difficult
- For backwards compatibility with older implementations

  **When to use each method**: Use the metadata approach (Method 1) whenever possible. Only use the model parameter prefix (Method 2) when technical constraints prevent you from modifying the metadata field.
