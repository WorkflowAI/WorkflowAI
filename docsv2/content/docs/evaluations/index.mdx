# Evaluations

Build better AI applications through systematic testing, benchmarking, and continuous evaluation of your models and prompts.

## Overview

Evaluations help you measure and improve the quality of your AI applications. Whether you're optimizing prompts, comparing models, or ensuring consistent performance, our evaluation platform provides the tools and metrics you need.

## Types of Evaluations

### Prompt Evaluation
Test and optimize your prompts across different scenarios:
- **Consistency Testing**: Ensure stable outputs across runs
- **Edge Case Analysis**: Test boundary conditions
- **Prompt Variations**: Compare different phrasings
- **Template Optimization**: Find the best prompt templates

### Model Comparison
Compare different models or versions:
- **Quality Metrics**: Accuracy, relevance, coherence
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Latency and throughput
- **Cost Analysis**: Token usage and pricing
- **A/B Testing**: Statistical significance testing

### Regression Testing
Ensure changes don't degrade performance:
- **Automated Test Suites**: Run tests on every change
- **Historical Comparisons**: Track performance over time
- **Alert on Regressions**: Get notified of quality drops
- **Version Tracking**: Link evaluations to model versions

## Creating Evaluations

### Define Test Cases
```python
test_cases = [
    {
        "input": "Summarize this article about climate change",
        "expected_themes": ["global warming", "emissions", "solutions"],
        "max_length": 200
    },
    {
        "input": "Translate 'Hello world' to Spanish",
        "expected_output": "Hola mundo",
        "exact_match": True
    }
]
```

### Configure Evaluation
```python
from evaluations import Evaluator

evaluator = Evaluator(
    model="gpt-4",
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=1000
)

results = evaluator.run(test_cases)
```

### Analyze Results
```python
# View aggregate metrics
print(results.summary())

# Detailed analysis
for result in results:
    print(f"Test: {result.test_name}")
    print(f"Score: {result.score}")
    print(f"Latency: {result.latency}ms")
```

## Evaluation Metrics

### Quality Metrics
- **Relevance**: How well outputs match the intent
- **Accuracy**: Correctness of factual information
- **Coherence**: Logical flow and consistency
- **Completeness**: Coverage of required topics

### Performance Metrics
- **Latency**: Response time distribution
- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Token Efficiency**: Output quality per token
- **Cost Efficiency**: Quality per dollar spent

### Custom Metrics
Define your own evaluation criteria:
```python
def custom_metric(input, output):
    # Your custom logic
    score = calculate_score(input, output)
    return score

evaluator.add_metric("custom_metric", custom_metric)
```

## Evaluation Workflows

### Continuous Evaluation
```yaml
# .github/workflows/evaluate.yml
name: Model Evaluation
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  evaluate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: pip install evaluation-sdk
      - run: python run_evaluations.py
      - run: python report_results.py
```

### Scheduled Evaluations
Run evaluations on a schedule to catch drift:
```python
# Schedule daily evaluations
scheduler.add_job(
    run_evaluation,
    trigger="cron",
    hour=2,
    minute=0
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a few key test cases
2. **Use Real Data**: Base tests on actual user interactions
3. **Balance Metrics**: Consider both quality and performance
4. **Automate Everything**: Integrate into your CI/CD pipeline
5. **Track Trends**: Monitor metrics over time, not just snapshots
