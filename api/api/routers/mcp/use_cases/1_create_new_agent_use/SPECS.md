## Scenario 1: Build Text Summarization Agent from Scratch

### intial state:

```python
(empty repo)
```

### goal: (as the end-user would write in Codex, Cursor, etc.)

give me 3 options (models) from choose from with pros and cons.
```

### what is required:

- a way to get the code of the agent
- API keys
- a way to run the code for a given input to test it (either via the code, via the API directly)
- evaluate the output of the agent
- access the price
- access the tools available on the platform.
- ...
