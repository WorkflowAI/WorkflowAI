### Cursor Setup

TODO add a direct link to install the MCP once built by Guillaume?

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to `Settings...`
3. Navigate to `Cursor Settings`
4. Select `MCP Tools`
5. Select `New MCP Server`

Add the following configuration to your MCP servers config:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "workflowai": {
         "url": "https://api.workflowai.com/mcp/",
         "headers": {
           "Authorization": "Bearer <your_api_key_here>"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
Replace `<your_api_key_here>` with your actual WorkflowAI API token.

Cursor UI should now look like this (note the green indicator and the number of tools enabled displayed):

2. Type the following to install:

```bash
claude mcp add workflowai https://api.workflowai.com/mcp/ --transport http -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your WorkflowAI API key.

3. Type the following to verify the server is properly connected:
