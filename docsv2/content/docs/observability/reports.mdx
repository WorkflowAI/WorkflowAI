## Overview

Generate comprehensive text-based reports for individual agents using conversational AI. Simply describe what you want to analyze about a specific agent, and our intelligent system will gather the data and provide detailed insights.

## How It Works

1. **Select an Agent**: Choose which agent to analyze
2. **Ask Your Question**: Describe what you want to know in natural language
3. **Get Text Report**: Receive a detailed text-based analysis (no graphs or visualizations)
4. **Follow-up**: Ask additional questions to refine your analysis

## Example Queries

```
"From the runs in the last week, analyze which conversations didn't go well and what are the reasons why they didn't go so well?"
```

```
"Search for all runs in the last month with response times over 5 seconds. What's causing the delays?"
```

```
"Review runs with sentiment scores below 0.5 from this week. What common issues can you identify?"
```

```
"Compare this agent's performance between this month and last month. What changed?"
```
