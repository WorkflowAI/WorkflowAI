# Documentation Review: Agent Identification Methods

## Overview

I reviewed all documentation files under `docsv2/content/docs/` to find pages where the statement "agent prefix needs to be added to the `metadata` field as the preferred way to identify the agent" is incorrect.

## Key Finding

**The statement is incorrect throughout ALL documentation files that discuss agent identification.**

## What the Documentation Actually Says

The documentation consistently describes using `agent_id` in the metadata field as the preferred way to identify agents, NOT "agent prefix". Here are the specific pages and their correct guidance:

### 1. **Observability Overview** (`docsv2/content/docs/observability/index.mdx`)
- **Lines 43-56**: Shows the correct method using `agent_id`
```python
metadata={
  "agent_id": "my-agent-id", # [!code highlight]
}
```

### 2. **Inference Models** (`docsv2/content/docs/inference/models.mdx`)
- **Line 16**: States "you can identify your agent by adding `agent_id` to your metadata"
- **Lines 33, 40, 47, 64, 71, 78, 91, 101**: Multiple examples showing `agent_id` usage
- **No mention of "agent prefix" anywhere**

### 3. **Observability Runs** (`docsv2/content/docs/observability/runs.mdx`)
- **Lines 35-65**: Examples showing `agent_id` in metadata
- **Lines 74-87**: Special metadata keys table lists `agent_id` as the standard key
- **No mention of "agent prefix"**

### 4. **Deployments** (`docsv2/content/docs/deployments/index.mdx`)
- **Line 266**: States "Deployments work with named agents only" and references identifying agents
- **Examples throughout show `agent_id` in metadata**
- **No mention of "agent prefix"**

### 5. **OpenAI Agents Quickstart** (`docsv2/content/docs/quickstarts/openai-agents.mdx`)
- **Lines 96-139**: Section titled "Identify your agent" but uses agent names, not prefixes
- **No mention of "agent prefix" or metadata field usage**

### 6. **Other Files with Metadata Examples**
The following files all show `agent_id` usage in metadata, never "agent prefix":
- `observability/conversations.mdx`
- `inference/structured-outputs.mdx`
- `reference/supported-parameters.mdx`
- `use-cases/mcp.mdx`
- `use-cases/classifier.mdx`

## What's Missing: No "Agent Prefix" References

I searched extensively for any mention of:
- "agent prefix" - **0 matches found**
- "prefix" (in any context) - **0 matches found**

## Conclusion

**Every page that discusses agent identification is incorrect according to the given statement.** The documentation universally promotes `agent_id` in the metadata field as the preferred identification method, not "agent prefix".

## Recommendation

If "agent prefix" is supposed to be the preferred method, then the following pages need to be updated:
- All observability documentation
- All inference documentation  
- All deployment documentation
- All quickstart guides
- All example code snippets

Alternatively, if `agent_id` is indeed the correct method, then the statement being checked is simply wrong and should be corrected.
