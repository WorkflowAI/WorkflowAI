> "I expect that we will see AI agents that can accomplish a wide range of knowledge work tasks in the next few years." — [_Sam Altman_](https://blog.samaltman.com/reflections)

Have you ever wished you could create a little application _just for your business?_

To qualify leads, segment customers, extract data from PDFs, analyze large data sets, send reminders, or even keep an eye on compliance while you’re on vacation.

This is the promise of AI _agents:_ a new generation of AIs that can use apps for you, and plug in to all your company knowledge and tools. Unlike the first wave of AIs that largely answered questions inside chat interfaces, you can send _agents_ off on their own — like little workers — to do repetitive tasks for you. And they can do them at lightning speed.

**But what agents should you create? And how should you create them?**

That’s where we come in. At WorkflowAI, we’re making it easy to discover what kinds of agents can help your business. And then, we create them for you in minutes.

Handy little apps and automations made _just for you._

They might just change how you work forever.
