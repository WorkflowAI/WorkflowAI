title: OpenAI Ruby Code
summary: How to use the official OpenAI Ruby SDK with WorkflowAI. WorkflowAI exposes a compatible OpenAI API endpoint. The only changes you need to make are updating the `api_base` and `access_token`.
---

```ruby
require "openai"

# setup WorkflowAI client
client = OpenAI::Client.new(
  api_base: "https://run.workflowai.com/v1", # [!code highlight]
  access_token: "wai-***", # use create_api_key MCP tool # [!code highlight]
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  # your existing code
)
```
