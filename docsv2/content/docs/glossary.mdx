## Schema


## Version

A version is a specific **configuration** of an agent.

WorkflowAI defines two types of (agent) versions:

| Version Type | Example | Description |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| **Major** Versions | 1, 2, 3, ... | A major version represents a specific configuration of a agent, including its instructions, temperature, descriptions/examples, and tools. |
| **Minor** Versions | 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, ... | A minor version represents a major version **associated with a specific model** (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini). |
