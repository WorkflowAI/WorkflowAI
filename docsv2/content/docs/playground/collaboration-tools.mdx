## Sharing Playgrounds: Easily share specific playground states with team members 

TODO: add more

The playground generates unique URLs for each state, making collaboration effortless. Every time you run a prompt, adjust parameters, or switch models, a new shareable URL is created that captures that exact configuration. This means you can easily share specific runs and version combinations with your team members, allowing them to see exactly what you tested and reproduce your results instantly.

## Code-Free Deployments: Deploy changes seamlessly without code modifications

### Why use deployments?

- ✅ Update models or prompts without involving your engineering team
- ✅ Save costs by switching to newer, cheaper models without code changes
- ✅ Improve output quality by adjusting prompts in real-time based on user feedback
- ✅ Use different versions across environments (development, staging, production)

### How to deploy?

If you just ran a version in the playground that you want to deploy, you can deploy it directly from there.

1. Find the deploy button (circled arrow icon) in the output column:
   - Top of the column (next to model name)
   - Metadata section (below output)
2. Select your target environment: production, staging, or dev
3. Click the deploy button
4. If this is the first time you deploy a version of this agent, you will need to update your code. You can find updated code on the Code page, or ask the MCP to update your code for you [TODO: clarify phrasing/process re: the MCP]
