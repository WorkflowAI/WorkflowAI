## Versioning: Test freely without fear of losing your work

TODO: clean up

Track, compare, and manage different versions of your prompts to maintain a history of improvements and easily revert changes.

Here are the parameters that comprise a version:

### Prompt/System Message

TODO add

### Temperature
Temperature is a parameter that controls the randomness of the LLM's outputs. WorkflowAI provides three preset temperature settings:

<Accordions defaultValue="Precise (Default)">
<Accordion title="Precise (Default)">
The recommended and default setting for all tasks

- Best for tasks requiring accuracy and consistency
- Ideal for factual responses, code generation, or structured data extraction
- Produces reliable, repeatable results
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Balanced">
Moderate setting that balances creativity and coherence

- Good for general-purpose tasks
- Works well for most conversational and analytical tasks
- Provides reasonable variation while maintaining relevance
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Creative">
Maximum diversity and exploration

- Best for tasks requiring unique or innovative outputs
- Ideal for brainstorming, creative writing, or generating alternatives
- Produces more varied but potentially less focused results
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Custom">
User-defined temperature setting

- Allows precise control over the temperature value
- For advanced users who understand the impact of temperature
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

"Precise" is automatically selected as the default temperature setting for all new features to ensure consistent and reliable outputs. You can adjust this in the Parameters section of the Playground if your use case requires more variation.

### Descriptions and Examples

Descriptions and Examples are optional fields available for string-based fields that can be used to provide additional, field-specific information to the LLM. If you find that the prompt instructions alone are not guiding the LLM to handle a specific field, you can add or modify the description or examples to help the LLM understand the field better.

- **Description**: A description of the field can including what it is and/or what it is used for.
- **Examples**: You can add one or multiple examples of a field to help the LLM understand what the field formatting should look like.

Examples and Descriptions edits are made on the playground by:
- **In all cases:** Asking the playground agent to make an update on your behalf by describing the change
- **If output is currently displayed:** Hovering over a field name, then hover over the description/examples modal and tap Edit
- **If no output is displayed:** Hovering over a description or example and tap Edit

## Model Comparison: Compare [X] different models to find the best one for your use case. 

TODO: clean up

...
- number of models [view supported models](/docs/reference/supported-models)
- no setup required (no API key)

The playground is WorkflowAI's tool to allow quick and easy iterating on prompts and models, so you can create the best version of your AI feature possible.

## Price and Latency Comparison: See the price and latency for each model you try

For each output, WorkflowAI also displays:
- ðŸ’° Cost: The total price in USD for generating this output
- âš¡ Latency: How long it took to get a response from the model, in seconds
- ðŸ“Š Context window usage: How much of the model's maximum token limit was used, shown as a percentage

> WorkflowAI Cloud offers a price-match guarantee, meaning that you're not charged more than the price per token of the model you're using. Learn more about the price-match guarantee [here](https://workflowai.com/pricing).

## Output Diff Mode: Unlock easy output comparison with diff mode

Compare LLM outputs side-by-side with visual highlighting to easily spot differences between models and prompt variations.
You can enable diff mode to highlight the differences between LLM outputs, making it easy to spot differences in how models handle your task. Diff mode can be especially helpful for text-heavy outputs, like texts summarizations or composition.
