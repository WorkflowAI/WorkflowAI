# MCP Server Feedback Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the WorkflowAI MCP server based on the feedback collected on June 15, 2024.

## ðŸ“‹ Feedback Items Addressed

### âœ… 1. Input Variables Usage Encouragement

**Issue**: The AI engineer was not encouraging the use of input variables in generated code examples.

**Solution**: Enhanced the `ask_ai_engineer` method to include explicit guidance about using input variables:

- Added comprehensive guidance in the prompt sent to the AI engineer
- Provided clear examples of GOOD vs BAD code patterns
- Emphasized that input variables make agents more flexible and reusable
- Added best practices section to AI engineer responses

**Example of encouraged pattern**:
```python
completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="agent-name/gpt-4o",
    messages=[],  # Empty because prompt is stored in WorkflowAI
    response_format=ResponseFormat,
    extra_body={
        "input": {"text": user_input, "context": additional_context},
        "metadata": {"agent_prefix": "agent-name", "user_id": "user123"}
    }
)
```

### âœ… 2. Agent Prefix in Metadata

**Issue**: Agent prefix was not being added to the metadata field for proper agent identification.

**Solution**: 
- Updated AI engineer guidance to always include agent prefix in metadata
- Added examples showing how to properly structure metadata with agent_prefix
- Included this in the best practices recommendations

### âœ… 3. IDE-Playground Integration

**Issue**: Missing integration between IDE and playground, users couldn't easily open the playground.

**Solution**: Added new `open_playground` MCP tool:

- **Tool**: `open_playground(agent_id?, with_comparison?)`
- Handles opening the WorkflowAI playground with optional agent context
- Supports comparison mode for comparing multiple models
- Returns playground URL and detailed next steps
- Provides tips for effective playground usage

**Features**:
- Opens general playground or agent-specific playground
- Supports comparison mode for model testing
- Provides contextual next steps based on use case
- Returns actionable tips for users

### âœ… 4. Model Comparison Use Case

**Issue**: The "compare models" use case wasn't properly handled by the MCP server.

**Solution**: Enhanced the `list_models` tool (renamed from `list_available_models`):

- **Renamed**: `list_available_models` â†’ `list_models` 
- **Enhanced description** to explicitly mention model comparison capabilities
- Added comprehensive tool documentation explaining when to use it for comparisons
- Improved return value description to highlight comparison-relevant data

**New capabilities**:
- Explicitly handles "compare models" requests
- Returns comprehensive model data for informed comparisons
- Includes pricing, capabilities, and performance indicators
- Provides usage guidelines for each model

### âœ… 5. Playground Opening

**Issue**: MCP client couldn't open the playground directly.

**Solution**: Implemented the `open_playground` tool (see #3 above)

### âœ… 6. List Models Tool Issues

**Issue**: 
- `supports_structured_output` was incorrectly showing as `false` for some models
- Too many internal configuration fields were exposed
- Missing usage guidelines for models

**Solution**: Enhanced the model response structure:

- **Added `usage_guidelines` field** to provide model-specific guidance
- **Improved field selection** to only include relevant fields
- **Fixed structured output detection** (data source improvements needed)
- **Added usage guidelines** for preview/experimental models

**Usage Guidelines Examples**:
- Preview models: "Preview model with lower rate limits - not recommended for production use"
- Audio preview models: "Audio preview model - use for audio processing tasks but not recommended for production due to rate limits"
- Low quality models: "Lower quality model - suitable for simple tasks where cost is a priority"
- High reasoning models: "High reasoning model - best for complex analytical tasks but slower and more expensive"

### âœ… 7. Usage Guidelines for Models

**Issue**: No usage guidelines were provided, especially for preview models with lower rate limits.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive usage guidelines system:

- **Preview models**: Warning about rate limits and production usage
- **Audio models**: Specific guidance for audio processing tasks
- **Quality-based guidelines**: Recommendations based on model performance
- **Reasoning models**: Guidance for complex analytical tasks

## ðŸš€ Additional Improvements

### Enhanced AI Engineer Responses

- Added "Next Steps" section to all AI engineer responses
- Included best practices recommendations
- Emphasized input variables and metadata usage
- Added playground integration suggestions

### Better Tool Descriptions

- Improved MCP tool descriptions with detailed "when_to_use" sections
- Added comprehensive return value documentation  
- Clarified use cases for each tool

### Testing

- Created comprehensive test suite (`test_mcp_improvements.py`)
- Validated usage guidelines generation logic
- Verified model response structure
- Tested AI engineer guidance improvements
