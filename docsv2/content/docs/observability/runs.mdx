## Definition

A run is ...

## View runs for a specific agent

### Using the UI

A run is a single execution of an agent. For example:

![Run view](/images/runs/run-view.png)

Each run has a unique identifier and can be accessed directly via a URL, like [this example run](https://workflowai.com/docs/agents/review-summary-generator/runs/0195dd7a-6977-7197-7ec3-4fc44ade50dc).

<Callout type="warning">
**Privacy Note**: Run URLs are private by default and only accessible to users within your organization. They are not publicly accessible, ensuring your data and AI interactions remain secure.
</Callout>

By default, WorkflowAI stores all runs, available in the "Runs" section. You can view a list of all runs for a specific agent, like [this example runs list](https://workflowai.com/docs/agents/review-summary-generator/1/runs?page=0).

![Run list](</images/runs/list-runs.png>)

#### Metadata

When viewing a run, you can see the metadata added to the run.

## Search runs

### Using the UI

WorkflowAI provides a powerful search – available under the "Runs" section – to find specific runs:

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingTop: '56.25%' }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://customer-turax1sz4f7wbpuv.cloudflarestream.com/d2f9b4f417bda8734b0a6f474f621d29/iframe?autoplay=false&muted=false&controls=true"
    style={{ 
      border: 'none', 
      position: 'absolute', 
      top: 0, 
      left: 0,
      height: '100%', 
      width: '100%' 
    }}
    allow="accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;"
    allowFullScreen={true}
  ></iframe>
</div>

<Callout type="info">
**Architecture**: Under the hood, runs are stored in a Clickhouse database, which is optimized for handling large amounts of data, and for fast search and aggregation queries. Clickhouse also compresses data, which reduces storage costs. Learn more about Clickhouse [here](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/introduction).

```

## View a run's prompt and response (completions)

### Using the UI

WorkflowAI provides full transparency into the interaction with the LLM. You can easily examine both the raw prompt sent to the model and the complete response received:

1. Navigate to any run's detail view
2. Click the "View Prompt" button to see the exact instructions sent to the LLM

You can try viewing the prompt for [this example run](https://workflowai.com/docs/agents/review-summary-generator/runs/0195dd7a-6977-7197-7ec3-4fc44ade50dc).

## Load in playground

To import a run into the playground, you can use either:
- the "Try in playground" button in the run detail view, which will automatically import the run input, and the version used to generate the run.
- only import the run input, by clicking on the "Try Input in Playground" button in the run detail view.

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingTop: '56.25%' }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://customer-turax1sz4f7wbpuv.cloudflarestream.com/7e570d6af89ed145009edda4289444b9/iframe?autoplay=false&muted=false&controls=true"
    style={{ 
      border: 'none', 
      position: 'absolute', 
      top: 0, 
      left: 0,
      height: '100%', 
      width: '100%' 
    }}
    allow="accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;"
    allowFullScreen={true}
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Load from here... (copy to be adjusted)

Sometimes in a chat conversation, you want to load the conversation from a specific point in time. 

TODO: @anya add video showing how to load a run from here.

## Delete a run

Deleting a specific run is not possible. However, you can delete all runs for a specific agent, by deleting the agent.
