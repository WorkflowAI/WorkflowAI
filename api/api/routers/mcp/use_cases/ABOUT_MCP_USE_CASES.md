# MCP Use Cases: Integration Test Scaffolding

## Overview

The MCP use cases serve as **scaffolding for integration tests** that validate the end-to-end functionality of our Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementations across different programming languages and environments.

## Purpose

These use cases provide a structured, reproducible way to:
- Test MCP implementations across multiple programming languages
- Validate that code transformations and updates work as expected
- Ensure consistent behavior across different runtime environments
- Create a standardized testing framework for MCP functionality

## Directory Structure

Each use case follows a consistent structure:

```
use_cases/
├── ABOUT_MCP_USE_CASES.md          # This documentation
└── [use_case_name]/
    ├── initial_state.py            # Python starting code
    ├── initial_state.ts            # TypeScript starting code
    ├── initial_state.[lang]        # Additional language implementations
    ├── GOAL.md                     # Command/transformation to execute
    └── EVALUATION.md               # Assertions and expected outcomes
```

## Integration Test Workflow

### 1. **Initial State Setup**
Each use case defines initial code states in multiple programming languages:
- `initial_state.py` - Python implementation
- `initial_state.ts` - TypeScript implementation
- Additional language files as needed

These files represent the **starting point** before any MCP operations are applied.

### 2. **Goal Definition**
The `GOAL.md` file contains:
- The specific command or transformation to trigger in Cursor / Windsurf / Claude Code / Codex

### 3. **Execution Phase**
During testing, the system will:
1. Load the appropriate initial state file for the target language
2. Apply the command/transformation specified in `GOAL.md`
3. Execute the resulting updated code

### 4. **Evaluation & Assertions**
The `EVALUATION.md` file defines:
- Expected outcomes and behavior
- Assertions to validate the transformation worked correctly
