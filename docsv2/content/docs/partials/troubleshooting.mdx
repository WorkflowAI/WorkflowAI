<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="I don't see my agent in the dashboard" id="agent-dashboard">
    - Check that your agent has made at least one request through WorkflowAI. The agent will appear in the dashboard after its first successful request.
    - Verify there are no errors in your application logs when making the API request.
    - Ensure you're using the correct API key and base URL (`https://run.workflowai.com/v1`).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm using OpenAI for multiple endpoints (responses API, embeddings, audio, etc.)" id="multiple-endpoints">
    If you are using OpenAI for multiple endpoints in your application:
    - **Only modify the client used for `chat/completions` requests** to point to WorkflowAI
    - **Keep using the standard OpenAI client** for all other endpoints (embeddings, Responses API, audio transcriptions, etc.)

    WorkflowAI only supports the `chat/completions` endpoint, so other OpenAI functionality should continue using the standard OpenAI client.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What parameters (`stream`, `temperature`, `max_tokens`, etc.) are supported?" id="supported-parameters">
    See the [reference/parameters.md](reference/parameters.md) documentation for a full list of supported parameters.
