WorkflowAI Cloud is a fully managed version of WorkflowAI, maintained by the WorkflowAI team.

## [Direct link to heading](https://docs.workflowai.com/workflowai-cloud/introduction\#when-to-use-workflowai-cloud)    When to use WorkflowAI Cloud?

We recommend using WorkflowAI Cloud unless you have strict requirements on data-retention, data-residency, or compliance.

For example, WorkflowAI Cloud is hosted only in the US at the moment, so if you want to have your data hosted in the EU, you should use WorkflowAI as a [self-hosted solution](https://github.com/workflowai/workflowai).

The benefits of using WorkflowAI Cloud versus our own deployment are:

- ✅ Fully managed: we take care of the infrastructure, so you can focus on building your AI agents.

- ✅ Always up-to-date: we ensure that you're always using the latest stable version of WorkflowAI.

- ✅ Cheaper: we offer a price-match guarantee, meaning that you're not charged more than the price per token of the model you're using. Learn more about the [price-match guarantee](https://docs.workflowai.com/workflowai-cloud/pricing). Effectively cheaper than self-hosting.

- ✅ Reliability: we ensure that your AI agents are [always available](https://docs.workflowai.com/workflowai-cloud/reliability)

- ✅ Compliance: [SOC 2 Type 2 certification](https://docs.workflowai.com/workflowai-cloud/compliance).

- ✅ Security: Enterprise SSO available, free of charge. [Learn more](https://github.com/WorkflowAI/documentation/blob/main/docs/cloud/security.md).
