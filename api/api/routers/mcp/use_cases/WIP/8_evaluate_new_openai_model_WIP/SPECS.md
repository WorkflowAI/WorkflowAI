## Scenario 8: Evaluate New OpenAI Model Performance

### initial state:

```
- agent is running on WorkflowAI with current model (e.g., gpt-4o)
- agent has historical performance data
- new OpenAI model is available (e.g., gpt-4o-2024-11-20)
```

### goal:

```
- try how the new model from OpenAI performs on this agent
- compare quality, speed, and cost between current and new model
- decide whether to upgrade the agent to use the new model
```

### what is required:

- ability to duplicate/clone existing agent with new model configuration
- access to run the same prompts/inputs on both model versions
- quality comparison tools to evaluate output differences
- A/B testing capabilities to run parallel experiments
- access to latency metrics for both models
- cost analysis and reporting for token usage comparison
- performance benchmarking tools
- ability to run test suites against both model versions
- statistical analysis to determine significance of differences
- rollback capabilities if new model underperforms
- gradual rollout tools to test with subset of users first
