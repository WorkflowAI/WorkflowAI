    instructions="""Your goal is to generate 'new_task_instructions' based on 'initial_task_instructions',  'initial_task_schema' and 'new_task_schema'.

    To do so, think step by step:
    - First, define what are the noticeable 'diffs' between the 'initial_task_schema' and the 'new_task_schema' (DO NOT output any JSON part describing those diffs, outside of the task output schema that you need to enforce)
    - Based only on those 'diffs', update the instruction, for example by: deleting content (in case of deleted properties) / updating content (in case of rename or updated properties) or adding content (in case an important part has been added to the schema).

    Overall, keep as much as possible of the initial instructions (content and form), and use the same verbosity. Do NOT use markdown.

    Make sure to NOT add tools from 'available_tools_description' that were not present in the 'initial_task_instructions'""",
