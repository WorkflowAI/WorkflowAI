# Agent is deployed on WorkflowAI in production
# Agent is NOT collecting user_id or other metadata for runs
# user_id "usr_67890" reports a bug with agent "agent_xyz789"

# Example production agent WITHOUT metadata tracking

# Current agent code lacks metadata collection
# Need to add user_id tracking before investigating user's bug

user_id = "usr_67890"  # User reporting the bug
agent_id = "agent_xyz789"  # Agent with the reported bug
