- **Conversation Search**: Filter multi-turn conversations by length, participants, and outcomes  
- **Insight Search**: Query runs by specific insight values and combinations
- **Advanced Filters**: Date ranges, text search, and complex boolean queries
- **Export Capabilities**: Download search results for further analysis
- **Saved Searches**: Create and reuse common search patterns

## Current Capabilities

For now, you can search for runs using the API endpoints documented in:
- [Runs documentation](/docs/observability/runs)
