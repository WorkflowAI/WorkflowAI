NUMBER_OF_SUGGESTED_AGENTS = 20

INSTUCTIONS = f"""Your role is to generate a comprehensive list of exactly {NUMBER_OF_SUGGESTED_AGENTS} non overlapping agents suggestions that can be used to power features for our client based on:

    - 'company_context' (in order to understand the company and propose agents that make sense based on the company's context)
    - the 'supported_agent_input_types' and 'supported_agent_output_types' that explains the type of agents input and output that can be suggested.
    - consider the 'available_tools' that can give suggested agent more capabilities.
    - use 'latest_news' to propose agents that are super relevant and impactful for the company based on the latest news. Offer features that works well with the latest product and features, and aligns with the company goals from 'latest_news'. Aim for 1 to 2 agents over {NUMBER_OF_SUGGESTED_AGENTS} to be related to the latest news, IF and only IF those agents do not contradict with the other criterias, and if the enforece all other criterias described in those instructions. For agents that are based on latest news, please make sure that the description makes it clear that the feature is related to the latest news.
    - the client's 'existing_agents' (in order to avoid duplicates, and propose new agents that make sense based on the agents the client is already using)

    ## Agents to propose
    - Propose features that are scalable and can be seamlessly integrated into the client's existing products.
    - Prioritize features that solve key problems and DIRECTLY enhance user experience (as opposed to agents that are used internally by the company).
    - Ensure that the agent represents one atomic operation that: 1) takes a structured input of 'supported_agent_input_types', 2) optionally uses 'available_tools' and LLM reasoning in order to 3) output a structured output of 'supported_agent_output_types'. Avoid multiple operations within a single agent.
    - Ensure that the suggested agents are relevant to the company's domain and can be realistically implemented using LLM technology.
    - Aim to provide a diverse set of agent suggestions that cover different aspects of the company's potential needs.
    - Propose 1 non chat-based agent over {NUMBER_OF_SUGGESTED_AGENTS} suggested agents that the company can use to include chat features in their products (INPUT: messages with special payload based on the use case, domain specific, etc. OUTPUT: answer message with special payload based on the use case). For chat based agent, make sure to include 'Chat' in the 'suggested_agents.name'.
    - Think in terms of a "AI roadmap", if you were the CEO/CPO of the company, which diverse and coherent roadmap would you build ?
    - IMPORTANT: SOLELY propose straightforward, agents that are easy to understand the purpose of. AVOID obscure use cases like "Optimizer", "Matcher", "Scheduler", "Workflow Improver", "Reminder", "Recommender", etc. STAY FOCUSED ON CLEARLY UNDERSTANDABLE AGENTS like classification, summarization, information extraction, image and document analysis, etc. See "Examples of agents" below for inspiration for straightforward agents, also see 'Agents to AVOID' below for agents to avoid. AVOID at all costs agents that could be replaced by a fixed set of deterministic rules. Your suggestions must be related to the 'Examples of agents to propose' below. Once AVOID CONVOLUTED AGENTS.

    ## Agents to AVOID
    - Avoid "one-off" agents that won't fit in the user's product on the long term.
    - Avoid agent targeted at the internal functions (software development, documentation, accounting, HR, etc.). Focus on CLIENT-FACING agents that DIRECTLY IMPACT the final user's experience.
    - Avoid image generation and design use cases as we currently do not support images in the output (see 'supported_agent_output_types')
    - Avoid use cases that do not make sense with LLM technology and work perfectly well with deterministic code (ex: arithmetic operation, calculators, deterministic data analysis, etc. basically things you can write code to do). Also avoid hardware optimization agents since they probably require human engineering skills that are beyong LLM capabilities. Focus on software oriented agents.
    - Avoid privacy related agents because the clients are unlikely to pass privacy related data to LLM provider anyway.

    ### Examples of agents to AVOID
    - Roadmap Timeline Estimator (can be done deterministically with a simple arithmetic formulas)
    - Integration Health Monitor (can be done deterministically with simple monitoring rules)
    - Team Workload Balancer (can be done deterministically with simple rules)
    - Project Health Dashboard (aggregated metrics can be done deterministically with simple formulas, plus "Dashboard" is TOO VAGUE and does not clearly describe the agent's purpose)
    - Integration Configuration Assistant (should probably be done with a fixed wizard)
    - ChatGPT Integration Configurator (should probably be handled with a fixed wizard)
    - Cross-Device Content Synchronization (must be handled with deterministic rules)
    - Privacy Policy Analyzer (too abstract, does not correspond to a specific use case like summarization, classification, etc.)
    - Privacy Policy Analyzer (because privacy related)
    - Cross-Device Feature Compatibility Checker (must be handled with deterministic rules)
    - Product Compatibility Checker (can be done deterministically with simple rules)
    - Accessibility Feature Recommender (must be handled with deterministic rules)
    - Device Setup Guide Generator (must be handled with deterministic rules)
    - Apple Intelligence Adoption Analyzer (must be handled with deterministic rules)
    - Use case related to documentation, compatibility, privacy policies, etc.
    - Content Accessibility Enhancer (too vague)

    Make sure to follow the instructions above, and to avoid the agents mentioned in the 'Agents to AVOID' section.

    # Guidelines for writing the name and description of the suggested agents
    - the 'suggested_agents.name' must follow the following convention: [subject that is acted upon] + [the action], in Title Case. Ex: 'Sentiment Analysis', 'Text Summarization', 'Location Detection'. Avoid using "Generation" in the agent name, as all agents perform generation anyway.
    - to generate 'suggested_agents.tag_line' act if you were a genius creative marketing copywriter that has personally worked with Steve Jobs for years. Generate a 12 words max, one-sentence, tagline that highlights how our the suggestedfeature agent / feature transforms the user's product. Emphasize transformation, simplicity, and efficiency in a style reminiscent of Apple’s marketing.
    - the 'suggested_agents.description' must be the natural complement of the 'tag_line'. When relevant, talk in terms of product management metrics: activation, engagement, retention, monetization, growth (referral) and asking youself "what metric(s) might be positively impacted by this AI feature" ?  300 Chars max.
    - the 'suggested_agents.description' must be concise and to the point.
