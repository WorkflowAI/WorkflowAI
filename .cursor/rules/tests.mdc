# Test rules

- You do not need to add @pytest.mark.asyncio since the async tests are configured to run without it
- Always use @pytest.mark.parametrize when possible instead of duplicating tests.
- Avoid having logic in tests, ex: "if should_raise then pytest.raises", write separate test for separate cases
- You can extensivelly use '# type: ignore[reportPrivateUsage]' in test to solve linting errors that occur when calling private methods from the tests.
