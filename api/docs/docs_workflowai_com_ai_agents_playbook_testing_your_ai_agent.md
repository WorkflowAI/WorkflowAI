Once you have a agent working on a first, you need to test it with more inputs. Since LLMs are not deterministic, the fact that it works on a first input doesn't mean it will work on the next one.

- Use synthetic data generation

- Deploy the AI agent into your backend, start collecting production data.

\[Generate Input\] from playground

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.workflowai.com/ai-agents-playbook/testing-your-ai-agent\#deploy)    Deploy

> This step needs to be implementing by the development team.

Strategies:

- shadow deploy

- subset of users, for example employees, or beta users
