# Claude MCP Server Connection Issue

## Problem Description

Connecting to our WorkflowAI MCP server using Claude code does not work as expected. Users are unable to establish a successful connection when following the standard MCP server setup instructions.

## How to Reproduce

### 1. Add the WorkflowAI MCP Server to Claude

```bash
claude mcp add workflowai <https://run-preview.workflowai.com/mcp/sse> --transport sse -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual WorkflowAI API key.

### 2. Test MCP Server Configuration

To verify that the MCP server is properly configured:

1. Start Claude:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

2. Use the MCP command to check server status:
   ```
   /mcp
   ```

This will show you the status of all configured MCP servers and confirm that the WorkflowAI server is connected.

## Expected Behavior

The MCP server should connect successfully and show as "connected" when checking the server status.

## Actual Behavior

The connection fails or shows an error state when attempting to connect to the WorkflowAI MCP server.
