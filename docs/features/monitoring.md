## Monitoring
An overview of each AI features run count and cost for the past week is available on your [home page](https://workflowai.com/), once logged in.

To get further insights to how an AI feature is performing, you can go to the "Cost" section from the sidebar menu, to access a dashboard with the number of runs, and cost metrics for additional time frames.
