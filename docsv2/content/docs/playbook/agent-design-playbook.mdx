# Agent Design Playbook

This playbook outlines the essential steps and processes that great AI engineers should follow when designing and building new agents in WorkflowAI. Whether you're working solo or as part of a team with other AI agents and humans, this guide will help you create robust, effective, and well-tested agents.

## Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements Gathering

### 1.1 Define the Agent's Purpose

Before writing any code, clearly articulate what your agent should accomplish:

- **Primary Objective**: What is the main task or problem your agent will solve?
- **Target Users**: Who will interact with this agent and what are their needs?
- **Success Criteria**: How will you measure if the agent is performing well?
- **Constraints**: What are the technical, business, or ethical limitations?

<Callout type="info">
Document your agent's purpose in a clear, one-sentence description. This will guide all subsequent design decisions.
</Callout>

### 1.2 Research Existing Solutions

- Review the [agents directory](/docs/agents) to understand existing agent patterns
- Check if similar functionality already exists in WorkflowAI
- Analyze comparable solutions in the market
- Identify gaps that your agent will fill

### 1.3 Stakeholder Alignment

- Present your agent concept to stakeholders and team members
- Gather feedback on the proposed functionality
- Align on success metrics and timeline
- Identify potential integration points with existing systems

## Phase 2: Technical Architecture & Design

### 2.1 Choose the Right Model

Select the appropriate model based on your agent's requirements:

- **Complexity**: Simple tasks may work with smaller models, complex reasoning requires larger ones
- **Latency**: Real-time applications need faster models
- **Cost**: Balance performance with budget constraints
- **Capabilities**: Ensure the model supports required features (function calling, structured outputs, etc.)

### 2.2 Design the Prompt Strategy

Create effective prompts that guide your agent's behavior:

```python
# Example system prompt structure
system_prompt = """
You are an expert [DOMAIN] assistant that helps users with [SPECIFIC_TASK].

Your responsibilities:
1. [Primary responsibility]
2. [Secondary responsibility]
3. [Error handling approach]

Guidelines:
- Be precise and factual
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
- Use available tools appropriately
- Provide structured responses when possible

When uncertain, acknowledge limitations and suggest alternatives.
"""
```

### 2.3 Identify Required Tools

Determine what tools your agent needs:

- **Hosted Tools**: Leverage WorkflowAI's built-in tools like `@google-search` or `@browser-text`
- **Custom Tools**: Design custom functions for specific domain needs
- **External APIs**: Plan integrations with third-party services
- **Data Sources**: Identify databases, files, or knowledge bases needed

<Tabs items={["Hosted Tools", "Custom Tools"]}>
  <Tab>
  ```python
  # Using hosted tools
  messages = [
      {
          "role": "system",
          "content": """Use @google-search to find recent information about {{topic}}.
          Use @browser-text to extract details from specific URLs when needed."""
      }
  ]
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```python
  # Custom tool example
  tools = [{
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
          "name": "query_database",
          "description": "Query the customer database for specific information",
          "parameters": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                  "query": {"type": "string", "description": "SQL query to execute"},
                  "limit": {"type": "integer", "description": "Maximum number of results"}
              },
              "required": ["query"]
          }
      }
  }]
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2.4 Plan the Conversation Flow

Design how your agent will interact with users:

- **Input Handling**: How will the agent process different types of user inputs?
- **State Management**: Does the agent need to remember previous interactions?
- **Error Recovery**: How will the agent handle failures or misunderstandings?
- **Escalation**: When and how should the agent escalate to humans?

## Phase 3: Implementation & Development

### 3.1 Set Up the Development Environment

- Create a new branch for your agent development
- Set up local testing environment with WorkflowAI
- Configure necessary API keys and credentials
- Establish logging and monitoring

### 3.2 Implement Core Functionality

Start with the minimal viable agent:

```python
# Basic agent structure
import openai
from workflowai import WorkflowAI

client = WorkflowAI()

def create_agent_completion(user_input, context=None):
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": your_system_prompt
        },
        {
            "role": "user", 
            "content": user_input
        }
    ]
    
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=messages,
        tools=your_tools,  # if applicable
        temperature=0.1,
        max_tokens=1000
    )
    
    return completion.choices[0].message
```

### 3.3 Implement Tool Integration

- Add custom tool functions with proper error handling
- Test tool integrations individually
- Ensure tools return structured, useful responses
- Implement fallback mechanisms for tool failures

### 3.4 Add Conversation Memory (if needed)

```python
# Example conversation memory
class ConversationMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []
    
    def add_message(self, role, content):
        self.history.append({"role": role, "content": content})
        
    def get_context(self, max_messages=10):
        return self.history[-max_messages:]
```

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation

### 4.1 Unit Testing

Create comprehensive unit tests:

- Test core agent functions
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error handling scenarios
- Validate tool integrations

```python
# Example unit test structure
def test_agent_basic_response():
    response = create_agent_completion("Hello, how can you help me?")
    assert response.content is not None
    assert len(response.content) > 0

def test_agent_with_tools():
    response = create_agent_completion("Search for recent news about AI")
    assert response.tool_calls is not None
```

### 4.2 Integration Testing

- Test the complete agent flow end-to-end
- Validate tool interactions with real APIs
- Test conversation continuity
- Verify error handling with real failure scenarios

### 4.3 Manual Testing in Playground

Use WorkflowAI's playground to:

- Test various user inputs and edge cases
- Validate agent responses for accuracy and helpfulness
- Fine-tune prompts based on real interactions
- Test tool usage in realistic scenarios

<Callout type="tip">
Create a test script with 10-15 diverse inputs that cover your agent's main use cases. Run this script regularly during development.
</Callout>

## Phase 5: Evaluation & Optimization

### 5.1 Create Evaluation Dataset

Build a robust evaluation dataset:

- Collect 20-30 representative user inputs

### Success Metrics

Track these key indicators for your agent:

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct responses
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback scores and usage metrics
- **Cost Efficiency**: Token usage and computational costs
- **Latency**: Response time and user experience
- **Reliability**: Uptime and error rates

<Callout type="success">
Remember: Great agents are not built in isolation. Collaborate with your team, iterate based on feedback, and always prioritize user needs over technical complexity.
</Callout>

## Conclusion

Building effective AI agents requires a systematic approach that balances technical excellence with user needs. By following this playbook, you'll create agents that are not only functional but also maintainable, scalable, and valuable to your users.

The key to success is iteration—start with a simple, working agent and continuously improve based on real-world usage and feedback. Remember that the best agents are those that solve real problems for real users, not just showcase technical capabilities.
