# Repository Guidelines for AI Agents

- **Do not commit or modify `client/next-env.d.ts`.** This file is auto-generated by Next.js and should remain untracked. If missing, generate it locally but keep it out of version control.
- **Before pushing changes to the front-end**, run:
  - `yarn workspace workflowai tsc --noEmit`
  - `yarn workspace workflowai test --runInBand`
