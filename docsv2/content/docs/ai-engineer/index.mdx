# MCP Server Installation

## Pre-requisite: Get Your API key

You can browse [this page](https://workflowai.com/keys) to get your WorkflowAI API key

## Setup WorkflowAI MCP service for [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to `Settings...`
3. Navigate to `Cursor settings`
4. Select `Tools & integrations`
5. Press `New MCP Server`

Add the following configuration to your MCP servers config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflowai": {
      "url": "https://run.workflowai.com/mcp/sse/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>` with your actual WorkflowAI API token.

Cursor UI should now look like this (note the green indicator and the number of tools enabled displayed):

Once configured, you'll be able to use WorkflowAI's capabilities directly within Cursor through the MCP integration. Check the list of tools in the WorkflowAI part of `Tools & integrations` for more details about the available tools.

## Alternative Setup: Using [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)

If you prefer to use Claude Code, you can set up the MCP server with a single command:

```bash
claude mcp add workflowai https://api.workflowai.com/mcp/sse/ -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>" --transport http
```

Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>` with your actual WorkflowAI API token.

To check that your MCP client is correctly initialized, you can do:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

And check that `workflowai` is present.
