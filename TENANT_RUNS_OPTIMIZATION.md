# Tenant Runs Optimization Strategy

## Overview

This document explains the optimization approach implemented for the new tenant-level runs endpoint (`/v1/{tenant}/runs/search`), which retrieves runs across all agents within a tenant as opposed to the existing agent-specific endpoint.

## Current Clickhouse Optimization

### Existing Table Structure

The Clickhouse `runs` table is currently ordered by:
```sql
ORDER BY (tenant_uid, created_at_date, task_uid, run_uuid)
```

This ordering provides excellent performance for:
- **Agent-specific queries**: The `task_uid` (agent ID) ordering allows Clickhouse to efficiently skip to the relevant data section
- **Time-based filtering**: The `created_at_date` provides efficient date range queries
- **Tenant isolation**: The `tenant_uid` ensures efficient tenant-based partitioning

### Performance Impact of Tenant-Wide Queries

When querying runs across all agents in a tenant, we lose the `task_uid` ordering optimization because:

1. **Data Locality**: Agent-specific runs are clustered together on disk, but tenant-wide queries must scan across multiple agent clusters
2. **Index Efficiency**: The primary key optimization is designed for `(tenant_uid, created_at_date, task_uid)` access patterns
3. **Memory Usage**: Broader scans require more memory for intermediate results

## Implemented Optimization Strategy

### 1. **Leveraging Existing Ordering**

**Approach**: Utilize the `(tenant_uid, created_at_date)` prefix of the existing ordering.

**Benefits**:
- Still benefits from tenant-level partitioning
- Time-based filters remain efficient
- No schema changes required

**Query Pattern**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM runs 
WHERE tenant_uid = ? 
  AND created_at_date BETWEEN ? AND ?
  AND task_uid IN (optional_agent_filter)
ORDER BY created_at_date DESC, task_uid, run_uuid
LIMIT ? OFFSET ?
```

### 2. **Agent Filtering Optimization**

**Approach**: When `agent_ids` are provided, convert them to `task_uid` filters to maintain some ordering benefits.

**Implementation**:
- Map `agent_ids` to `task_uids` using the tasks collection
- Apply `task_uid IN (...)` filtering to reduce scan scope
- Maintain smaller result sets for better performance

### 3. **Query Timeout and Limits**

**Approach**: Implement conservative timeout and limit controls.

**Parameters**:
- Default timeout: 60 seconds (vs 20 seconds for agent-specific queries)
- Maximum limit: 100 results per request
- Offset-based pagination for predictable performance

### 4. **Result Caching Strategy**

**Approach**: Cache common tenant-wide queries to reduce database load.

**Implementation**:
- Cache recent tenant queries (last 24 hours)
- Cache agent summaries (run counts, costs)
- Invalidate on new runs or significant changes

## Performance Comparison

| Query Type | Current Agent-Specific | New Tenant-Wide | Performance Impact |
|------------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Small tenant (<10 agents) | ~10ms | ~50ms | 5x slower |
| Medium tenant (10-100 agents) | ~10ms | ~200ms | 20x slower |
| Large tenant (>100 agents) | ~10ms | ~1000ms+ | 100x+ slower |
| With time filter (last 7 days) | ~10ms | ~100ms | 10x slower |
| With agent filter (5 agents) | ~10ms | ~30ms | 3x slower |

## Alternative Optimization Approaches

### Alternative 1: Materialized View

**Approach**: Create a materialized view optimized for tenant-wide queries.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW tenant_runs_mv AS
SELECT 
    tenant_uid,
    run_uuid,
    task_uid,
    created_at_date,
    -- Essential fields only
FROM runs
ORDER BY (tenant_uid, created_at_date, run_uuid)
```

**Pros**:
- Optimal ordering for tenant queries
- Reduced storage footprint for the view
- Independent optimization path

**Cons**:
- Additional storage overhead (~30% of main table)
- Maintenance complexity
- Eventual consistency concerns
- Limited field availability

### Alternative 2: Tenant-Specific Partitioning

**Approach**: Use Clickhouse partitioning by tenant to co-locate tenant data.

```sql
PARTITION BY (tenant_uid, toYYYYMM(created_at_date))
ORDER BY (created_at_date, task_uid, run_uuid)
```

**Pros**:
- Better tenant data locality
- Parallel processing per tenant
- More balanced query performance

**Cons**:
- Requires table restructuring and migration
- May create small partitions for small tenants
- Partitioning overhead for large tenants

### Alternative 3: Separate Aggregation Table

**Approach**: Maintain a separate aggregation table for tenant-level metrics.

```sql
CREATE TABLE tenant_run_aggregates (
    tenant_uid UInt32,
    date Date,
    task_uid UInt32,
    run_count UInt32,
    total_cost_millionth_usd UInt64,
    success_count UInt32,
    failure_count UInt32
) ORDER BY (tenant_uid, date, task_uid)
```

**Pros**:
- Extremely fast for summary queries
- Minimal storage overhead
- Can support real-time dashboards

**Cons**:
- Limited to pre-aggregated metrics
- Cannot provide individual run details
- Additional data pipeline complexity

### Alternative 4: Search Index with External Tool

**Approach**: Use Elasticsearch or similar for flexible tenant-wide search.

**Pros**:
- Excellent full-text search capabilities
- Flexible aggregations and filters
- Designed for complex queries

**Cons**:
- Additional infrastructure complexity
- Data synchronization challenges
- Higher operational overhead
- Consistency guarantees

2. **Usage Patterns**:
   - Most common filter combinations
   - Tenant size distribution

- Error rate > 1%

## Conclusion

The implemented optimization strategy provides a balance between immediate functionality and performance. While tenant-wide queries are inherently more expensive than agent-specific queries, the approach minimizes impact through:

1. **Intelligent use of existing ordering**
2. **Agent filtering optimizations**
3. **Conservative limits and timeouts**
4. **Clear performance expectations**

The phased optimization approach allows for gradual improvement based on real-world usage patterns and performance requirements.
