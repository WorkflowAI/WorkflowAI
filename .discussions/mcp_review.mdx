Pierre:

Are we set on using FastAPI-MCP? 

I don't think the syntax is very good, comparing with the library I had used for my prototype.

For example, in FastAPI-MCP, we have to use `@app.get` with a URL, but we're not exposing any API REST, right?

```python
# Explicit operation_id (tool will be named "get_user_info")
@app.get("/users/{user_id}", operation_id="get_user_info")
async def read_user(user_id: int):
    return {"user_id": user_id}
```

Feels like FastAPI-MCP is made for people who want to expose an API REST as a MCP, but not building a proper MCP server from scratch. Looks like people on Github agree. https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp has 12.4k stars, but https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp has 5.4k stars.

As a reference, here is the code I had used for my prototype:

```python
# https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools
 @mcp.tool
 async def send_message(message: str, reply_to_message_id: str | None = None) -> dict[str, str]:
     # Note: Neon formats the MCP tool description using HTML-like tags for sections such as <use_case>, <workflow>, <important_notes>, <example>, <next_steps>, and <error_handling>.
```

Could you please explain the decision to use FastAPI-MCP? What are the advantages? and what are the disadvantages?

```python
@router.get(
    "/runs-details",
    operation_id="fetch_run_details",
    description="""
<when_to_use>
When the user wants to investigate a specific run of a WorkflowAI agent, for debugging, improving the agent, fixing a problem on a specific use case, or any other reason.
You must either pass run_id + agent_id OR run_url.
</when_to_use>
<returns>
Returns the details of a specific run of a WorkflowAI agent.
</returns>
""",
)
async def fetch_run_details(
    mcp_service: MCPServiceDep,
    agent_id: str | None = Query(
        description="The id of the user's agent, example: 'email-filtering-agent'. Pass 'new' when the user wants to create a new agent.",
        default=None,
    ),
    run_id: str | None = Query(
        description="The id of the run to fetch details for",
        default=None,
    ),
    run_url: str | None = Query(
        description="The url of the run to fetch details for",
        default=None,
    ),
) -> MCPToolReturn:
    """Fetch details of a specific agent run."""
    return await mcp_service.fetch_run_details(agent_id, run_id, run_url)
```

How do we know what parameters are actually passed to the MCP client? I'm assuming that `mcp_service` is not a tool parameter?

Why do we default to `"python"` for `user_programming_language` in `AskAIEngineerRequest`? Is it a good idea to make that field optional instead of required?
