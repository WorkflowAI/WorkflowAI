## Overview

WorkflowAI exposes a compatible OpenAI API endpoint. The only changes you need to make are updating the `base_url` and `api_key`.

WorkflowAI only supports the OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. If your existing agent uses other OpenAI endpoints, you'll need to maintain separate clients:

- **Supported**: `/v1/chat/completions` - Migrate this to WorkflowAI
- **Not Supported**: `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/audio/*`, `/v1/images/*`, and other OpenAI endpoints

**Migration Strategy**: Only change the client configuration for your chat/completions requests. Keep using the standard OpenAI client for all other endpoints (embeddings, responses API, audio transcriptions, image generation, etc.).

When migrating an existing agent to WorkflowAI, you'll get immediate access to 100+ models, observability features, and improved reliability while maintaining full compatibility with your existing chat completion code.
