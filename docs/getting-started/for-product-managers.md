# For product managers

AI features can help you bring intelligence to your product, using the same AI models powering ChatGPT.
WorkflowAI is designed to empower product managers to build and optimize AI features, **without writing code**. 

> "I’ve always had great ideas for AI features, but engineering resources were always the bottleneck. Now, with WorkflowAI, I’ve been able to build and improve AI features myself—no coding, no waiting.
> I can quickly go to market, gather customer feedback, and iterate fast."

## Why Product Managers like WorkflowAI:

### Go from idea to AI feature. No code needed.
Stop waiting on bandwidth. WorkflowAI lets anyone on your team design, test, and deploy AI features using plain language - no code needed.

### Tired of black-box AI? Now you can see inside.
When the AI gets it wrong, you need to know why — fast. WorkflowAI logs every input and output automatically, so you can spot issues, understand what went wrong, and fix it without waiting on engineering.

### No more switching tabs and spreadsheets to compare models.
WorkflowAI shows you outputs, costs, and latency side-by-side, all in one view.

### Edit prompts. Skip the tickets.
Tired of creating tickets just to tweak a prompt? WorkflowAI lets you update prompts instantly, no engineering work required. Go from feedback to fix in seconds.
