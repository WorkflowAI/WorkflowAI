There are three different settings that determine how users can join an organization. In order to change the settings from the default of **No automatic enrollment**, you will need to first enabled Verified Domains.

1. **Automatic invitations**: Users are automatically invited to join the organization when they sign-up and can join anytime.
2. **Automatic suggestions**: Users receive a suggestion to request to join, but must be approved by an admin before they are able to join the organization.
3. **No automatic enrollment (default)**: Users can only be invited manually to the organization.
