## Definition

A run is ...

## Metadata

<Callout type="warning">
We highly recommend reading this section. Metadata is essential for debugging and troubleshooting your AI agents.
</Callout>

You can attach custom metadata to a run. Think of metadata as the fields you or your AI engineer will use for debugging and troubleshooting. For example, when a customer reports an issue, you or your AI engineer will want to search by `user_id`, `customer_id`, or `session_id` to find their specific runs. Add these identifiers as metadata so you or your AI engineer can easily trace problems back to specific users, sessions, or contexts.

### Setup

<Callout type="info">
**Using WorkflowAI's AI Engineer**:

```
Add the following metadata to the agent "my-agent-id" using WorkflowAI:
user_id, user_email.
```
</Callout>

```python
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}],

### Special metadata keys

| Key | Description | Example | Added automatically |
|-----|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `agent_id` | The ID of the agent that generated the run | `summarizer-agent`, `translation-agent` | No |
| `conversation_id` | Groups related runs into [conversations](/docs/observability/conversations) for multi-turn interactions | `01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef` | Yes |
| `environment` | The environment of the run | `production`, `staging`, `development` | Yes, when using a deployment |
| `source` | The source of the run request | `my+app` (from proxy), `WorkflowAI` (from web app) | Yes |
| `temperature` | The temperature setting used in the LLM | `0.7`, `1.0` | Yes |

  TODO: @guillaume to check all the metadata keys and add them to the table.
  Double check the value I listed above too. For example, `dev` or `development`?

### Discover available metadata fields

Before searching for runs by metadata, you need to know what metadata fields are available for your agent. WorkflowAI provides several ways to discover the available metadata fields:

#### Using MCP

If you're using WorkflowAI's MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, you can use the `get_agent` tool to discover available metadata fields:

```
Use the get_agent MCP tool with agent_id "my-agent-id" to see available metadata fields
```

The response will include a `metadata_fields` array with the exact field paths you can use for filtering:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "agent_id": "my-agent-id",
    "metadata_fields": [
      "metadata.user_id",
      "metadata.user_email", 
      "metadata.session_id",
      "metadata.environment",
      "metadata.source"
    ],
    // ... other agent details
  }
}
```

You can then use these exact field paths in the `search_runs` tool:

```
Search for runs where metadata.user_id equals "123" and metadata.environment equals "production"
```

#### Using the API

<Callout type="info">
TODO: @guillaume Document the API endpoint(s) that will return available metadata fields for an agent. This could be part of the agent details endpoint or a separate metadata discovery endpoint.
</Callout>

Then, you can [search for runs by metadata](/docs/observability/runs#search-runs).

## View runs for a specific agent

### Using the UI

A run is a single execution of an agent. For example:

![Run view](/images/runs/run-view.png)

Each run has a unique identifier and can be accessed directly via a URL, like [this example run](https://workflowai.com/docs/agents/review-summary-generator/runs/0195dd7a-6977-7197-7ec3-4fc44ade50dc).

<Callout type="warning">
**Privacy Note**: Run URLs are private by default and only accessible to users within your organization. They are not publicly accessible, ensuring your data and AI interactions remain secure.
</Callout>

By default, WorkflowAI stores all runs, available in the "Runs" section. You can view a list of all runs for a specific agent, like [this example runs list](https://workflowai.com/docs/agents/review-summary-generator/1/runs?page=0).

![Run list](</images/runs/list-runs.png>)

#### Metadata

When viewing a run, you can see the metadata added to the run.

## Search runs

### Using the UI

WorkflowAI provides a powerful search – available under the "Runs" section – to find specific runs:

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingTop: '56.25%' }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://customer-turax1sz4f7wbpuv.cloudflarestream.com/d2f9b4f417bda8734b0a6f474f621d29/iframe?autoplay=false&muted=false&controls=true"
    style={{ 
      border: 'none', 
      position: 'absolute', 
      top: 0, 
      left: 0,
      height: '100%', 
      width: '100%' 
    }}
    allow="accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;"
    allowFullScreen={true}
  ></iframe>
</div>

<Callout type="info">
**Architecture**: Under the hood, runs are stored in a Clickhouse database, which is optimized for handling large amounts of data, and for fast search and aggregation queries. Clickhouse also compresses data, which reduces storage costs. Learn more about Clickhouse [here](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/introduction).

```

## View a run's prompt and response (completions)

### Using the UI

WorkflowAI provides full transparency into the interaction with the LLM. You can easily examine both the raw prompt sent to the model and the complete response received:

1. Navigate to any run's detail view
2. Click the "View Prompt" button to see the exact instructions sent to the LLM

You can try viewing the prompt for [this example run](https://workflowai.com/docs/agents/review-summary-generator/runs/0195dd7a-6977-7197-7ec3-4fc44ade50dc).

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingTop: '56.25%' }}>

## Load in playground

To import a run into the playground, you can use either:
- the "Try in playground" button in the run detail view, which will automatically import the run input, and the version used to generate the run.
- only import the run input, by clicking on the "Try Input in Playground" button in the run detail view.

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingTop: '56.25%' }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://customer-turax1sz4f7wbpuv.cloudflarestream.com/7e570d6af89ed145009edda4289444b9/iframe?autoplay=false&muted=false&controls=true"
    style={{ 
      border: 'none', 
      position: 'absolute', 
      top: 0, 
      left: 0,
      height: '100%', 
      width: '100%' 
    }}
    allow="accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;"
    allowFullScreen={true}
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Load from here... (copy to be adjusted)

Sometimes in a chat conversation, you want to load the conversation from a specific point in time. 

TODO: @anya add video showing how to load a run from here.

## Delete a run

Deleting a specific run is not possible. However, you can delete all runs for a specific agent, by deleting the agent.
