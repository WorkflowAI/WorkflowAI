WorkflowAI is an [open-source](https://github.com/workflowai/workflowai) platform for [product](https://docs.workflowai.com/getting-started/for-product-managers) and [development](https://docs.workflowai.com/getting-started/for-developers) teams to design, deploy and optimize [AI agents](https://docs.workflowai.com/ai-agents-playbook/what-is-an-ai-agent).

Please give us a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/workflowai/workflowai) to follow updates.

If you're new to WorkflowAI, you can start by [building your first AI agent in 5 minutes](https://docs.workflowai.com/getting-started/first-agent). You can also [migrate an existing prompt to WorkflowAI](https://docs.workflowai.com/getting-started/migrate).

Then we recommend you to read the [playbook](https://docs.workflowai.com/ai-agents-playbook/introduction) to learn more about how to build, test, improve, and optimize your AI agents.

Read about our [pricing](https://docs.workflowai.com/workflowai-cloud/pricing) and [reliability](https://docs.workflowai.com/workflowai-cloud/reliability).

To learn more about the concepts, you can read the [concepts](https://github.com/WorkflowAI/documentation/blob/main/docs/concepts/ai-agents.md) section.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.workflowai.com/\#why-workflowai)    Why WorkflowAI?

Building AI agents is more than simply writing a prompt. You need to pick the right model, iterate on the prompt, and observe what is working on production, or not. You might need to run benchmarks to find the best model and prompt for an acceptable cost. Then there are tools which enables agents: tools needs to be managed as well. You'll need to monitor operational issues (what if OpenAI is down?). Protection against prompt injection can be important as well. And we haven't discussed fine-tuning, distillation, and how to deal with large amount of information for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), which will require a vector database, embesdding... On top of that, AI is now multi-modal, and needs to be able to process images, audio, and video.

WorkflowAI is built to help you with all these challenges as one [open-source platform](https://github.com/workflowai/workflowai), available on-prem, or managed by [WorkflowAI Cloud](https://docs.workflowai.com/workflowai-cloud/introduction).
