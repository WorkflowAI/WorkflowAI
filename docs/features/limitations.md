## What use-cases are not well supported (yet!)?

Currently, WorkflowAI does not support:
- image generation. However AI features can understand and process images as input.
- listening and participating in real-time audio conversations. However AI features can understand audio files as input. 
- creating custom tools. However, AI features can use several hosted tools to search the web and browse websites.
- fine-tuning and distillation. But you can export the outputs of an agent from WorkflowAI and use them in your own fine-tuning pipeline
- RAG.

We expect that all these use cases will be supported in the future (by end of 2025).
